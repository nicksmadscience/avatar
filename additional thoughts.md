additional thoughts

- Drupal and continuing to use Confluence are the most advanced options
    - Both have a full USWDS theme
    - Drupal is extremely commonly used for usfedgov sites
    - Many development hours have already been worked for the Drupal migrator in particular.  Though this was done for sites other than Science, we'd be adapting instead of building from scratch

- WordPress could be another good option
    - A USWDS theme may exist for this?  The USWDS site doesn't make it super clear but we will investigate
    - Could be a good fit for a site that takes the form of many silo'd spaces instead of a strict hierarchy
    - Migrator would have to be adapted for Wordpress

Dokuwiki, Concrete, and Wagtail would be the most work
    - No USWDS theme exists for these that we can find
    - Migrator would have to be adapted for all of these
